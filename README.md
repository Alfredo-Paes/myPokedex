# My Pokedex
> This project is a simple pokedex, which list in a table the 150 pokemons of first generation.

To populate the table, a PokeAPI was used. According to PokeAPI's own description, the RESTful API interfaces with highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of Pokémon-related data, specifically related to the Pokémon game franchise.

On the front-end, Nes.css was used, an incredible framework that offers an 8-bit look, that is, very cool pixel art to use with the Pokémon theme.
